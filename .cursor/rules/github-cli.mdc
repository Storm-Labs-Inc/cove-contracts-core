# GitHub CLI Usage Rules

This rule defines how to effectively use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for retrieving information about issues and pull requests.

## Core Commands

### Issue Commands
```bash
# List issues
gh issue list --limit 10 | cat

# View specific issue details
gh issue view ISSUE_NUMBER | cat

# List issues with specific state
gh issue list --state {open|closed|all} | cat

# Search issues with specific label
gh issue list --label "bug" | cat
```

### Pull Request Commands
```bash
# List pull requests
gh pr list --limit 10 | cat

# View specific PR details with comments
gh pr view [PR_NUMBER | URL | BRANCH] -c | cat

# List PRs with specific state
gh pr list --state {open|closed|merged|all} | cat

# View PR diff
gh pr diff [PR_NUMBER | URL | BRANCH] | cat
```

## Important Notes

1. Always append `| cat` to commands to prevent pager issues in the terminal
2. Use `--json` flag for structured output when needed
3. Default limit is set to 10 items to prevent overwhelming output
4. Commands should be run from within the repository directory
