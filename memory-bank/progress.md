# Progress Report: Cove Asset Management Protocol

Reference: [Cove RFC](https://docs.cove.finance/technical/cove/rfc)

## Completed Features & Milestones (Inferred for Core Protocol)

1.  **Core `BasketManager` & `BasketManagerUtils` Implementation:**

    - Centralized asset custody and accounting logic for multiple baskets.
    - Basket creation using `BasketToken` clones (via `BasketManagerUtils`).
    - Full rebalance lifecycle management: `proposeRebalance`, `proposeTokenSwap`, `executeTokenSwap`,
      `completeRebalance`.
    - State machine for rebalance status (`Status` enum) with associated checks and transitions.
    - Internal trade (CoW) settlement logic within `BasketManagerUtils`.
    - External trade execution via `delegatecall` to `TokenSwapAdapter`s.
    - Processing of pending deposits and redeems during rebalance proposals.
    - Pro-rata redemption logic for `BasketToken`s.
    - Role-based access control (`AccessControlEnumerable`) for admin, manager, and various rebalance roles.
    - Pausable and rescuable mechanisms.
    - Fee mechanism (management and swap fees) with integration to `FeeCollector`.
    - Integration with `AssetRegistry` and `StrategyRegistry`.

2.  **`BasketToken` Implementation:**

    - ERC-20 compliant LP token, likely with extensions for managing bitFlags, strategies, and admin controls via
      `BasketManager`.
    - Initialization logic tied to `BasketManagerUtils.createNewBasket`.

3.  **Supporting Contract Implementations:**

    - `AssetRegistry.sol`: For managing asset lists and their status.
    - `FeeCollector.sol`: For handling protocol fees.
    - `StrategyRegistry.sol` and `WeightStrategy.sol` base/interfaces likely in place.
    - `TokenSwapAdapter.sol` interface and potentially some initial implementations.

4.  **Oracle Framework (Sub-component of Cove):**

    - `ChainedERC4626Oracle.sol` is developed and tested (as per previous narrower focus).
    - Other adapters like `ERC4626Oracle.sol`, `CurveEMAOracleUnderlying.sol`, `AnchoredOracle.sol` are likely developed
      as part of the Euler Price Oracle integration strategy mentioned in RFC.
    - Integration with `EulerRouter` for oracle lookups from `BasketManagerUtils`.
    - Recent updates to Pyth oracle deployment configurations for staging (e.g., `MAX_STALENESS` set to 60s).

5.  **Initial Documentation & Code Quality:**

    - Natspec comments present in `BasketManager.sol`, `BasketManagerUtils.sol`, and other core contracts.
    - Use of custom errors for reverts.
    - Code organized into relevant directories (`libraries`, `strategies`, `swap_adapters`, `oracles`).
    - Slither findings addressed and events cleaned up in various contracts.

6.  **Operator Framework (New):**
    - `BasicRetryOperator.sol` implemented to allow claiming of fulfilled/fallback deposits and redeems, with optional
      automated retry logic. This provides a mechanism for users or keepers to manage positions affected by rebalancing
      delays or issues.

## Current Status: Core Infrastructure Built, Needs Extensive Testing & Integration

- The foundational smart contracts for the Cove protocol, especially `BasketManager` and its utilities, appear to be
  largely implemented, providing the core logic for asset management and rebalancing.
- The system design from the RFC regarding roles, rebalance lifecycle, and modular components (strategies, swap
  adapters, oracles) is reflected in the codebase.
- The `ChainedERC4626Oracle` (a specific oracle type) is mature. Oracle configurations (e.g. Pyth staleness) are
  actively being refined for different environments.
- A new `BasicRetryOperator` has been introduced, enhancing user experience for pending/fallback states.
- The protocol is now at a stage where comprehensive end-to-end testing, integration of all modular parts (various
  strategies, swap adapters, operators), security hardening, and gas optimization are critical.

## Known Issues or Areas for Further Investigation (General for a complex protocol)

- **Gas Costs:** The complexity of `BasketManagerUtils` and the multi-step rebalance process might lead to high gas
  costs for certain operations. Requires thorough benchmarking.
- **Off-Chain Dependencies:** Robustness of interaction with off-chain components like `TokenSwapProposer` and
  monitoring keepers needs to be ensured.
- **Oracle Security & Accuracy:** Continuous monitoring and validation of oracle feeds are crucial.
- **Scalability:** Performance with a very large number of baskets or assets per basket.
- **Complexity:** The system has many interacting parts; ensuring all edge cases are handled correctly is a significant
  challenge.

## Immediate & Upcoming Next Steps (For the Cove Protocol)

1.  **Full System Integration Testing:**
    - Create test suites that cover interactions between `BasketManager`, `BasketToken`s, various `WeightStrategy`
      implementations, and multiple `TokenSwapAdapter`s.
    - Test deposit, withdrawal, and full rebalance cycles with diverse scenarios (e.g., only internal trades, only
      external, mixed, multiple baskets rebalancing).
2.  **Development and Testing of Modular Components:**
    - Implement and test a variety of `WeightStrategy` contracts.
    - Implement and test different `TokenSwapAdapter`s (e.g., for CoW Swap, specific DEX aggregators).
3.  **Gas Optimization Pass:**
    - Profile gas usage of all major functions in `BasketManager` and `BasketManagerUtils`.
    - Refactor for gas savings where possible without compromising security or clarity.
4.  **Security Audit Preparation:**
    - Conduct internal security reviews of all core contracts.
    - Address any findings from static analysis tools (Slither, Mythril, Solhint).
    - Prepare comprehensive documentation for external auditors, detailing architecture, state transitions, access
      controls, and potential risks.
5.  **Off-Chain Component Finalization:**
    - Finalize and test the `TokenSwapProposer` logic (if an in-house off-chain component).
    - Set up and test monitoring keepers (e.g., for oracle price deviations, paused states).
    - Test and document keeper interactions with `BasicRetryOperator.sol`.
6.  **Enhanced Documentation:**
    - Complete all Natspec comments with detailed explanations, especially for `BasketManagerUtils` internal functions.
    - Write user guides, developer integration guides, and detailed API references.
    - Document deployment scripts and procedures.
7.  **UI/UX Integration (If Applicable):**
    - Begin integration with any planned front-end interfaces and test user flows.

**(Note: Previous "Next Steps" for ChainedERC4626Oracle are now subsumed into broader testing/audit of the oracle
framework within Cove.)**
