# Active Context: Cove Asset Management Protocol

Reference: [Cove RFC](https://docs.cove.finance/technical/cove/rfc)

## Current Implementation Status (Inferred)

The core Cove protocol contracts, particularly `BasketManager.sol`, `BasketToken.sol`, and `BasketManagerUtils.sol`,
appear to be substantially developed, implementing a complex system for asset management, rebalancing, and LP
tokenization as outlined in the RFC.

**Key Implemented Functionalities (Based on RFC and Code Structure):**

- **`BasketManager` Core Logic:**
  - Manages multiple roles via `AccessControlEnumerable` (`_MANAGER_ROLE`, `_PAUSER_ROLE`, `_REBALANCE_PROPOSER_ROLE`,
    etc.).
  - Handles creation of new baskets (`createNewBasket`) using `BasketToken` clones.
  - Centralized storage via `BasketManagerStorage` struct (logic largely in `BasketManagerUtils`).
  - Rebalance lifecycle with defined states (`Status` enum: `NOT_STARTED`, `REBALANCE_PROPOSED`, `TOKEN_SWAP_PROPOSED`,
    `TOKEN_SWAP_EXECUTED`).
  - Functions for proposing rebalances (`proposeRebalance`), proposing token swaps (`proposeTokenSwap`), executing swaps
    (`executeTokenSwap` via `delegatecall` to adapter), and completing rebalances (`completeRebalance`).
  - Fee management (`setManagementFee`, `setSwapFee`, `collectSwapFee`).
  - Pausable (`pause`, `unpause`) and rescuable (`rescue`) functionalities.
  - Integration with `AssetRegistry`, `StrategyRegistry`, and `EulerRouter` for oracles.
- **`BasketManagerUtils` Logic:** Contains detailed implementation for:
  - Basket creation, including `BasketToken` initialization.
  - Rebalance proposal logic, including pre-processing of deposits/redeems.
  - Token swap proposal validation (internal and external trades), including slippage checks.
  - Rebalance completion logic, including processing external trade results and finalizing basket states.
  - Pro-rata redemption logic for `BasketToken`s.
  - Complex accounting for asset balances within baskets and pending values.
- **`BasketToken` Functionality:** LP token likely implementing standard ERC-20 methods along with custom logic for
  minting/burning tied to `BasketManager` operations, and interaction with its `WeightStrategy`.
- **Oracle Framework:** `ChainedERC4626Oracle` and other oracle adapters are developed, integrating with the
  `EulerRouter`. Pyth oracle configurations for staging have been recently updated (new staleness parameters, potential
  redeployments).

## Recent Key Changes/Focus Areas

- **Introduction of `BasicRetryOperator.sol`:** A new operator contract to help users claim fulfilled or fallback
  deposits/redeems, with an option to automatically retry operations using fallback assets/shares. This enhances UX
  around rebalance-affected transactions.
- **Pyth Oracle Staging Update:** Deployment scripts and configurations for Pyth oracles in the staging environment have
  been updated, specifically adjusting the `MAX_STALENESS` to 60 seconds. This involved redeploying several
  `AnchoredOracle` and underlying Pyth-based oracles.
- Ongoing refinement of the rebalancing logic within `BasketManagerUtils.sol` to ensure correctness and gas efficiency.
- Integration and testing of various `TokenSwapAdapter`s and `WeightStrategy` implementations.
- Robustness testing of the rebalance state machine in `BasketManager.sol`.
- Ensuring accurate value calculations and LP share accounting across diverse market conditions and basket compositions.

## Immediate Next Steps & Priorities (General for a protocol of this scale)

1.  **Comprehensive End-to-End Testing:**
    - Develop extensive integration tests covering the full lifecycle: basket creation, deposits, multiple rebalance
      scenarios (internal CoW, external swaps via different adapters, mixed), withdrawals, fee collection.
    - Test with a wide variety of `WeightStrategy` implementations and asset types (including ERC4626 vaults).
    - Forked mainnet testing with realistic asset prices and liquidity conditions.
    - Fuzz testing for all critical functions, especially those involving arithmetic and external calls
      (`BasketManagerUtils`, `TokenSwapAdapter` interactions).
2.  **Gas Optimization & Benchmarking:**
    - Systematically benchmark gas costs for all user-facing functions and rebalancing operations.
    - Identify and optimize gas hotspots throughout the `BasketManager` and `BasketManagerUtils` call chains.
3.  **Security Hardening & Audit Preparation:**
    - Thorough review of access controls, reentrancy guards, and input validation across all contracts.
    - Validate security of `delegatecall` usage with `TokenSwapAdapter`s.
    - Address all findings from static analysis tools (Slither, Solhint).
    - Verify oracle integrations and fallback mechanisms are secure.
    - Prepare detailed technical documentation for security auditors.
4.  **Off-Chain Component Development/Testing:**
    - If the `TokenSwapProposer` (using linear programming) is an off-chain component built by the team, ensure its
      logic is sound and its interaction with the on-chain `proposeTokenSwap` is robust.
    - Test off-chain keeper roles for monitoring (e.g., oracle prices, rebalance stuck states) and potentially for
      triggering `BasicRetryOperator` functions.
5.  **Documentation & Developer Experience:**
    - Finalize Natspec for all contracts, functions, events, and errors.
    - Create comprehensive developer documentation covering protocol architecture, integration guides, and deployment
      procedures.
    - Develop user guides for interacting with the Cove protocol.
